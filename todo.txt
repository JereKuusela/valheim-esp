General:
 * Text system refactored. Add functions that require a dictionary (enum to text). Then the caller function can decide what to show and in what order.

Drawer:
 - Some kind of color customization (rgb + string to color).
 * List of priority names (different color and width can be set).
 - Cover lines (with different color if they get hit): windmills, crafting stations.
 - Rocks and their support somehow visualized

HUD:
 - Current stamina consumption

Structures:
 - Dimensions? Hitboxes visualized?

Creatures:
 - Eating cooldown.
 - Move speed (depending how it moves?)
 - Targeting system (current status, target, last known location, retreat limit, retreat when struch, etc.)


TODO:
 - Better tooltips (ammo, etc, if something is missing). Like for ammos to show +0 velocity.
 - Some way to not show custom hovertexts when empty (own hovertext type with check instead of adding the default one?)
 - Fix exiting ship doesnt work when creature ray comes up.
 - Item drops on ground (despawn timer with conditions, stacksize?)
 - Stacksize to item tooltips
 - Excludion list for effects.
 - Destructibl, etc item drops

Changes:
 - Trees, ores and other destructibles show minimum tool tier.
 - Trees, ores and other destructibles now have a location ray.
 - Enemy attacks no longer show damage, hit box or other info for non-attacks.
 - Player weapons and enemy attacks show the hit box type.
 - Player weapons and enemy attacks with chop or pickaxe show the tool tier.
