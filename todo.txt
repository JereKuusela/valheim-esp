General:
 * New text class for visuals that gets text based on the object? (onei issue is that then you would get all info)
  * Actions: E to freeze creature, numbers to start events when hovering the event ray, etc

Drawer:
 - Some kind of color customization (rgb + string to color).
 * List of priority names (different color and width can be set).

HUD:
 - Current stamina consumption

Structures:
 - Dimensions? Hitboxes visualized?

Creatures:
 - Move speed (depending how it moves?)
 - Targeting system (current status, target, last known location, retreat limit, retreat when struch, etc.)

 - Better tooltips (ammo, etc, if something is missing). Like for ammos to show +0 velocity.
 - Fix exiting ship doesnt work when creature ray comes up.


Todo:
 - Check world gen vegetations and items in those, add generation info?
 - Stacksize to item tooltips
 - Add "spawn blocked" to HUD for current location?
 - Windmill base line cover comparison (since 4-5 are blocked by the propeller).
 - Keybindings to settings.
 - Expand patrol points to include spawn points (since spawn point is used as fallback)
 - Better support for configuration manager plugin:
   - Add more specific tags / names to visuals and automatically show/hide (if possible).
   - Separate settings for showing/hiding and line widths (currently annoying to hide stuff as it's not one click).
   - Add keybinding for toggling different visuals (users can quickly toggle what they want).
 - Show object classnames on hover.
 - Experience meter to also include the first value (at least to total, over time to use average?).
 - Creatures: Add if creature doesn't attack objects to hover.
 - Generation parameters to locations, pickables, trees and rocks.

Changes:
 - Added average ship speed to HUD.
 - Added setting to ignore forsaken power cooldowns.
 - Added setting to set the maximum attack chain level.
 - Fixed for Hearth & Home patch.
