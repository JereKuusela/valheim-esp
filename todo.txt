General:
 * Text system refactored. Add functions that require a dictionary (enum to text). Then the caller function can decide what to show and in what order.
 * Actions: E to freeze creature, numbers to start events when hovering the event ray, etc

Drawer:
 - Some kind of color customization (rgb + string to color).
 * List of priority names (different color and width can be set).
 - Cover lines (with different color if they get hit): windmills, crafting stations.
 - Rocks and their support somehow visualized

HUD:
 - Current stamina consumption

Structures:
 - Dimensions? Hitboxes visualized?

Creatures:
 - Eating cooldown.
 - Move speed (depending how it moves?)
 - Targeting system (current status, target, last known location, retreat limit, retreat when struch, etc.)


TODO:
 - Better tooltips (ammo, etc, if something is missing). Like for ammos to show +0 velocity.
 - Some way to not show custom hovertexts when empty (own hovertext type with check instead of adding the default one?)
 - Fix exiting ship doesnt work when creature ray comes up.
 - Stacksize to item tooltips
 - Destructibl, etc item drops: Tin has DropOnDestroyed, everything else if minerock5 without "one of each" and individual stack size of 1
 - Enemy amount trackers (+ select which enemies)
 - Coordinates, forest factor, etc. to hud
 - Experience gains to HUD
