General:
 * New text class for visuals that gets text based on the object? (onei issue is that then you would get all info)
  * Actions: E to freeze creature, numbers to start events when hovering the event ray, etc

HUD:
 - Current stamina consumption

Creatures:
 - Move speed (depending how it moves?)
 - Targeting system (current status, target, last known location, retreat limit, retreat when struch, etc.)

 - Better tooltips (ammo, etc, if something is missing). Like for ammos to show +0 velocity.
 - Fix exiting ship doesnt work when creature ray comes up.


Todo:
 - Stacksize to item tooltips
 - Windmill base line cover comparison (since 4-5 are blocked by the propeller).
 - Expand patrol points to include spawn points (since spawn point is used as fallback)
 - Show object classnames on hover.
 - Creatures: Add if creature doesn't attack objects to hover.
 - Weapon skill.

 - Creature faction and group.
 - Only in forests is twice on enemy spawn zones.
 - Fix percentage precision for some, only spawn/generator stuff needs more precision!
 - Verify line widths (thicker for biome corners and smoke?)
