Drawer:
 - Setting for line widths per type.
 - Some kind of color customization (rgb + string to color).
 * List of priority names (different color and width can be set).

Spawn system:
 - Show active spawners: condition, chance, interval, timer, max spawn (with current amount).
 - Perhaps one object per spawner if there is lots of info?
