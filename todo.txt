General:
 * Text system refactored. Add functions that require a dictionary (enum to text). Then the caller function can decide what to show and in what order.

Drawer:
 - Setting for line widths per type.
 - Some kind of color customization (rgb + string to color).
 * List of priority names (different color and width can be set).
 - Cover lines (with different color if they get hit): windmills, crafting stations.
 - Rocks and their support somehow visualized

HUD:
 - Current stamina consumption

Structures:
 - Dimensions? Hitboxes visualized?

Creatures:
 - Eating cooldown and range (+spheres).
 - Move speed (depending how it moves?)
 - Targeting system (current status, target, last known location, retreat limit, retreat when struch, etc.)

Before release:
 - Add bow draw time
