General:
 * New text class for visuals that gets text based on the object? (onei issue is that then you would get all info)
  * Actions: E to freeze creature, numbers to start events when hovering the event ray, etc

Drawer:
 - Some kind of color customization (rgb + string to color).
 * List of priority names (different color and width can be set).
 - Rocks and their support somehow visualized

HUD:
 - Current stamina consumption

Structures:
 - Dimensions? Hitboxes visualized?

Creatures:
 - Eating cooldown.
 - Move speed (depending how it moves?)
 - Targeting system (current status, target, last known location, retreat limit, retreat when struch, etc.)

 - Better tooltips (ammo, etc, if something is missing). Like for ammos to show +0 velocity.
 - Fix exiting ship doesnt work when creature ray comes up.


Todo:
 - Stacksize to item tooltips
 - Add "spawn blocked" to HUD for current location?
 - Windmill base line cover comparison (since 4-5 are blocked by the propeller).
 - In game setting menu on the HUD (would hide settings under one line and enable more finely tuned approach).

Changes:
